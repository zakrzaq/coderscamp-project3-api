## Overview

The goal was to create API that will allow to manage restaurant chains. The data can be modified with three types of roles (user, owner and admin) which give different level of access to resources.

Collections:

-   users,
-   restaurantChains,
-   restaurants,
-   tables.

For authentication we use JWT (access token with expiration of 60 days with refresh token).
